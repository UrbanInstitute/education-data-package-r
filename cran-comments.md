## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have updated the vignettes to comply with the following policy (per an email from CRAN on 2025-10-15): 
> Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative message if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error).
