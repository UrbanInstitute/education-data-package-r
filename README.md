df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         subtopic = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 2008,
                                        grade = 9:12,
                                        ncessch = '340606000122'),
                         add_labels = TRUE)

## Main Filters

Due to the way the API is set-up, the variables listed within ‘main
filters’ are the fastest way to subset an API call.

In addition to `year`, the other main filters for certain endpoints
accept the following values:

### Grade

| Filter Argument      | Grade           |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| `grade = 'grade-pk'` | Pre-K           |
| `grade = 'grade-k'`  | Kindergarten    |
| `grade = 'grade-1'`  | Grade 1         |
| `grade = 'grade-2'`  | Grade 2         |
| `grade = 'grade-3'`  | Grade 3         |
| `grade = 'grade-4'`  | Grade 4         |
| `grade = 'grade-5'`  | Grade 5         |
| `grade = 'grade-6'`  | Grade 6         |
| `grade = 'grade-7'`  | Grade 7         |
| `grade = 'grade-8'`  | Grade 8         |
| `grade = 'grade-9'`  | Grade 9         |
| `grade = 'grade-10'` | Grade 10        |
| `grade = 'grade-11'` | Grade 11        |
| `grade = 'grade-12'` | Grade 12        |
| `grade = 'grade-13'` | Grade 13        |
| `grade = 'grade-14'` | Adult Education |
| `grade = 'grade-15'` | Ungraded        |
| `grade = 'grade-99'` | Total           |

### Level of Study

| Filter Argument                         | Level of Study     |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `level_of_study = 'undergraduate'`      | Undergraduate      |
| `level_of_study = 'graduate'`           | Graduate           |
| `level_of_study = 'first-professional'` | First Professional |
| `level_of_study = 'post-baccalaureate'` | Post-baccalaureate |
| `level_of_study = '99'`                 | Total              |

## Examples

Let’s build up some examples, from the following set of endpoints.

| Level   | Source | Topic      | Subtopic        | Main Filters | Years Available              |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------|:----------------|:-------------|:-----------------------------|
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | NA              | year, grade  | 1986–2022                    |
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | race            | year, grade  | 1986–2022                    |
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | race, sex       | year, grade  | 1986–2022                    |
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | sex             | year, grade  | 1986–2022                    |
| schools | crdc   | enrollment | disability, sex | year         | 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2020 |
| schools | crdc   | enrollment | lep, sex        | year         | 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2020 |
| schools | crdc   | enrollment | race, sex       | year         | 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2020 |

The following will return a `data.frame` across all years and grades:

``` r
library(educationdata)
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment')
```

Note that this endpoint is also callable by certain `subtopic`
variables:

- race
- sex
- race, sex

These variables can be added to the `subtopic` argument:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         subtopic = list('race', 'sex'))
```

You may also filter the results of an API call. In this case `year` and
`grade` will provide the most time-efficient subsets, and can be
vectorized:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         subtopic = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 2008,
                                        grade = 9:12))
```

Additional variables can also be passed to `filters` to subset further:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         subtopic = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 2008,
                                        grade = 9:12,
                                        ncessch = '3406060001227'))
```

The `add_labels` flag will map variables to a `factor` from their labels
in the API.

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         subtopic = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 2008,
                                        grade = 9:12,
                                        ncessch = '340606000122'),
                         add_labels = TRUE)
```

Finally, the `csv` flag can be set to download the full `.csv` data
frame. In general, the `csv` functionality is much faster when
retrieving the full data frame (or a large subset) and much slower when
retrieving a small subset of a data frame (especially ones with a lot of
`filters` added). In this example, the full `csv` for 2008 must be
downloaded and then subset to the 96 observations.

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         subtopic = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 2008,
                                        grade = 9:12,
                                        ncessch = '340606000122'),
                         add_labels = TRUE,
                         csv = TRUE)
```

## Summary Endpoints

You can access the summary endpoint functionality using the
`get_education_data_summary()` function.

``` r

df <- get_education_data_summary(
    level = "schools",
    source = "ccd",
    topic = "enrollment",
    stat = "sum",
    var = "enrollment",
    by = "fips",
    filters = list(fips = 6:8, year = 2004:2005)
)
```

In this example, we take the `schools/ccd/enrollment` endpoint and
retrieve the `sum` of `enrollment` by `fips` code, filtered to `fips`
codes 6, 7, 8 for the `year`s 2004 and 2005.

The syntax largely follows the original syntax of
`get_education_data()`: with three new arguments:

- `stat` is the summary statistic to be retrieved. Valid statistics
  include: `avg`, `sum`, `count`, `median`, `min`, `max`, `stddev`, and
  `variance`.
- `var` is the variable to run the summary statistic on.
- `by` is the grouping variable(s) to use. This can be a single string,
  or a vector of multiple variables, i.e., `by = c("fips", "race")`.

Some endpoints are further broken out by subtopic. These can be
specified using the `subtopic` option.

``` r
df <- get_education_data_summary(
    level = "schools",
    source = "crdc",
    topic = "harassment-or-bullying",
    subtopic = "allegations",
    stat = "sum",
    var = "allegations_harass_sex",
    by = "fips"
)
```

Note that only some endpoints have an applicable `subtopic`, and this
list is slightly different from the syntax of the full data API.
Endpoints with `subtopics` for the summary endpoint functionality
include:

- schools/crdc/harassment-or-bullying/allegations
- schools/crdc/harassment-or-bullying/students
- schools/crdc/restraint-and-seclusion/instances
- schools/crdc/restraint-and-seclusion/students
- college-university/ipeds/enrollment-full-time-equivalent/summaries
- college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/age/summaries
- college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/race/summaries
- college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/residence/summaries
- college-university/scorecard/student-characteristics/aid-applicants/summaries
- college-university/scorecard/student-characteristics/home-neighborhood/summaries

[full API
documentation](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/index.html#summary_endpoints).
